# File 2 URL Bot

A simple bot to convert files sent to it to URLs to make direct download links.

## Features

* Fast download speeds
* Option to allow only specific users to create download links
* Range support
* Database support

## Setup

At first download the program from [releases](https://github.com/HirbodBehnam/file2url-go/releases). Then before running
the application, set these values as environment variables:

```bash
export APP_ID=1234
export APP_HASH=abcd
export BOT_TOKEN=zyxw
export ALLOWED_USERS=1,2
```

`ALLOWED_USERS` is the list of user IDs which are allowed to use the bot. Do not specify this variable in order to make
the bot public.

You also have to specify these two environment variables:

```bash
export LISTEN=0.0.0.0:12345
export URL_PREFIX=my-ip-or-domain:12345
```

`LISTEN` is the listen address of the server. `URL_PREFIX` will be as the domain/ip of the links which are sent to
users.

Then simply run the executable file.

### Databases

This bot will use a database to store the file information which is mapped from a UUID. By default, bot will use an in
memory cache to store these values. This each entry has a TTL of one day by default.

You can change the in memory cache to [bbolt](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) in order to make the data persistent on
disk. To enable bbolt, set the environment variable of `BOLT_DB_PATH` to a file which is the database.
